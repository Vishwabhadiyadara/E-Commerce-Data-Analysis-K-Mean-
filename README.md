# Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis in E-commerce

## Overview

This project undertakes an in-depth analysis of a UK-based online retail dataset, covering transactions from 01/12/2010 to 09/12/2011. Through rigorous data preprocessing and RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) calculation, we segmented customers to tailor marketing strategies effectively. Our findings, grounded in RFM segmentation, reveal distinct customer groups, enabling personalized engagement and optimized customer experience.
